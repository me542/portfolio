            <h2>AquaMansi: Device</h2>
            <p>           Is an Arduino-based automated watering system designed to efficiently manage plant care. It uses soil moisture sensors to detect when plants need water, a real-time clock (RTC) to schedule irrigation, an SD card module to log data, and an LCD display to show current system status. A servo motor controls the water flow, while an ESP  module enables wireless communication with the app. This device ensures that plants are only watered when necessary, promoting healthy growth and reducing water waste</p>

            <h2>Sweep</h2>
            <p>                 A Commission is an IoT-based monitoring system designed to track both waste level and water level in real time. Built with smart sensors and microcontrollers, the device automatically detects when a trash bin is full or when a water container reaches a certain level. The data is transmitted wirelessly, allowing users to receive alerts, monitor status remotely, and make timely decisions whether for efficient waste collection or water resource management.</p>
